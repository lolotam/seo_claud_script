<h4>Frequently Asked Question</h4>
<p><strong>Q: What's the difference between a co-wash and regular shampoo?</strong></p>
<p>A: Unlike traditional shampoos that use harsh sulfates to create lather and strip oils, a <strong>co-wash cleanser</strong> like <strong>Coils & Curls</strong> uses gentle, conditioning ingredients to cleanse the hair and scalp. This maintains your natural moisture balance while still removing product buildup and impurities, making it ideal for dry, curly, or textured hair types that need extra hydration.</p>
