<h4>Frequently Asked Question</h4>
<p><strong>What makes Intense EDP different from other oriental fragrances?</strong><br>
<strong>Intense EDP</strong> distinguishes itself through its masterful balance of potent oud and amber notes with refreshing bergamot and sophisticated rose accords. Unlike many oriental fragrances that can feel overwhelming, <strong>Intense</strong> achieves remarkable projection while maintaining refinement and versatility. Its unique composition also features a higher concentration of fragrance oils than typical EDPs, resulting in exceptional longevity that can last well beyond 12 hours on skin and even longer on clothing. This makes it an outstanding value despite its <a href="https://xsellpoint.com/product/damou-al-dahab-edp-100ml/">premium positioning</a> in the luxury fragrance market. ðŸ’«</p>
