<h4>Frequently Asked Question</h4>

<p><strong>How does Light Blue Eau Intense differ from the original Light Blue?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Light Blue Eau Intense</strong> features a higher concentration of fragrance oils, resulting in enhanced longevity and projection. While it maintains the signature fresh, citrusy character of the original, the intense version amplifies the lemon notes and introduces amber woods in the base for a more pronounced and lasting dry-down. The bottle design also reflects this intensity with a deeper blue cap and a more saturated color scheme. For those who loved the original but wished it lasted longer, <strong>Light Blue Eau Intense</strong> is the perfect solution. ðŸ’«</p>
