<h3>The Heritage Behind <strong>La Panthere</strong></h3>

<p>The panther has been a symbol of Cartier since 1914, when Louis Cartier commissioned a painting called "Dame Ã  la panthÃ¨re" featuring a woman with a black panther at her feet. This feline became the emblem of Jeanne Toussaint, Cartier's creative director of jewelry, who was nicknamed "La PanthÃ¨re" for her bold personality. The <strong>La Panthere fragrance</strong> pays homage to this rich heritage, embodying the same spirit of fearless femininity. ðŸ’Ž</p>
