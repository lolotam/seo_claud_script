Building on the success of the original Scandal (2017), this <a href=\"https://www.wikiparfum.com/perfume/jean-paul-gaultier-scandal-absolu\">more intense version</a> was created by perfumers DaphnÃ© Bugey and Fabrice Pellegrin who masterfully balanced the sweetness of honey with sophisticated floral and woody notes. The result is a <a href=\"https://xsellpoint.com/product-category/best-sellers/\">bestselling fragrance</a> that embodies Gaultier's rebellious spirit while maintaining undeniable elegance.</p>\n\n<h4>Frequently Asked Question</h4>\n\n<p><strong>How does Scandal Absolu differ from the original Scandal?</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Scandal Absolu</strong> is a more intense and sophisticated interpretation of the original. While both share the honey signature, Absolu amplifies this note and introduces richer blood orange and more prominent tuberose elements. The base notes feature a more pronounced vanilla and sandalwood combination, creating a deeper, more sensual fragrance with enhanced longevity. The bottle also differs, featuring a luxurious burgundy color that reflects its more intense character compared to the original's pink hue.</p>\n\n<p>Experience the allure of <strong>Scandal Absolu</strong> and embrace your bold, confident side. This <a href=\"https://www.wikiparfum.com/perfume/jean-paul-gaultier-scandal-by-night\">captivating fragrance</a> is more than a perfumeâ€”it's a statement of feminine power that's impossible to ignore.
