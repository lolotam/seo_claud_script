<h3>Frequently Asked Question</h3>

<h4>How does La Panthere Legere differ from the original La Panthere?</h4>
<p>La Panthere Legere offers a more delicate interpretation of the original formula. While it maintains the signature gardenia note that defines the La Panthere line, the Legere version is brighter and more transparent, with enhanced fresh floral accords and a lighter musk presence. This makes it more versatile for daytime wear while still transitioning beautifully into evening occasions. The base notes are also softened, creating a more approachable yet equally sophisticated fragrance experience.</p>
