While it maintains the signature fresh, citrusy character of the original, the intense version amplifies the lemon notes and introduces amber woods in the base for a more pronounced and lasting dry-down. The bottle design also reflects this intensity with a deeper blue cap and a more saturated color scheme. For those who loved the original but wished it lasted longer, <strong>Light Blue Eau Intense</strong> is the perfect solution. ðŸ’«</p>\n\n<p>Indulge in the Mediterranean fantasy with <strong>Dolce & Gabbana Light Blue Eau Intense</strong> - where citrus brightness meets sensual depth in perfect harmony.
