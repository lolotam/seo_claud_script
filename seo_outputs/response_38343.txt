<h4>Frequently Asked Question</h4>
<p><strong>Q: How does pearl finish blush differ from matte blush?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Pearl finish blushes like Instyle N 6 contain fine light-reflecting particles that create a subtle luminosity on the skin, adding dimension and a healthy glow. Unlike matte blushes which provide flat color, <strong>pearl blushes</strong> offer a soft sheen that mimics the natural radiance of youthful skin without obvious glitter particles. This makes them particularly flattering for adding life to dull complexions and creating a three-dimensional effect on the cheeks.</p>
