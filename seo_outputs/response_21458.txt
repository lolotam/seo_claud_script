<h4>Frequently Asked Question</h4>
<p><strong>How does Le Beau Paradise Garden differ from the original Le Beau?</strong></p>
<p>While the original Le Beau focuses primarily on woody-aromatic notes with prominent coconut and tonka bean, <strong>Le Beau Paradise Garden</strong> introduces a more complex composition with the addition of fig leaf and sage. This creates a greener, more garden-inspired interpretation that feels fresher while maintaining the sensual DNA of the original. The longevity is also enhanced in this 125ml Eau de Parfum concentration, making it ideal for those seeking a more pronounced and lasting scent experience. ðŸ”¥</p>
